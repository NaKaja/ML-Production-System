# Streaming Pipeline Readme

## Overview

This README provides an overview of the streaming pipeline designed to consume, clean, transform, enrich, and publish messages within your project. The pipeline uses Apache Kafka as the messaging system and relies on a database for data enrichment. This document will guide you through the setup, components, and usage of the pipeline.

## Prerequisites

Before using the streaming pipeline, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Apache Kafka:** Set up an Apache Kafka cluster with at least two topicsâ€”one for incoming messages and another for outgoing messages. Ensure you have the necessary Kafka brokers and ZooKeeper configured.

- **Database:** Set up a database containing the data to be used for enrichment. Ensure the database schema and access credentials are correctly configured.

- **Programming Environment:** You will need a suitable programming environment for implementing the pipeline in python.

- **Kafka Producer and Consumer Clients:** Install and configure Kafka producer and consumer clients for python.

## Pipeline Components

The streaming pipeline consists of the following components:

1. **Kafka Producer:** This component produces messages to an input Kafka topic. Messages can be generated by various data sources such as sensors, logs, or external systems.

2. **Stream Processing:** The stream processing component consumes messages from the input Kafka topic, performs data cleaning and transformation operations, and enriches the messages with data from the database.

3. **Database Connector:** This connector facilitates communication between the stream processing component and the database. It retrieves data from the database to enrich the incoming messages.

4. **Kafka Producer (Output):** After processing and enrichment, the messages are sent to an output Kafka topic using a Kafka producer. These enriched messages are then available for downstream consumers.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and configure the streaming pipeline:

1. **Kafka Configuration:** Configure your Kafka cluster, including the creation of topics for input and output messages. Ensure that you have the necessary Kafka broker and ZooKeeper configurations in place.

2. **Database Configuration:** Set up and configure the database containing the data for enrichment. Ensure that you have the correct database schema and access credentials.

3. **Pipeline Code:** Implement the stream processing component in your chosen programming language. This component should consume messages from the input Kafka topic, perform data processing, and produce messages to the output Kafka topic.

4. **Database Connector:** Implement a database connector to retrieve data from the database for message enrichment.

5. **Environment Configuration:** Configure environment-specific settings such as Kafka and database connection details in a configuration file or environment variables.

6. **Deployment:** Deploy the pipeline components to your chosen infrastructure (e.g., cloud-based servers, containers, or dedicated hardware).

## Usage

To use the streaming pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Start the Kafka producer component to populate the input Kafka topic with messages.

2. Deploy and run the stream processing component. It will consume messages from the input Kafka topic, process them, enrich them using data from the database, and produce the enriched messages to the output Kafka topic.

3. Monitor the pipeline for any errors or issues during message processing.

4. Implement downstream consumers to consume the enriched messages from the output Kafka topic as needed.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To ensure the smooth operation of the streaming pipeline, consider the following:

- **Logging:** Implement robust logging to capture errors and debugging information during message processing.

- **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring tools and alerts to track the health and performance of the pipeline components.

- **Scaling:** Depending on the message load, you may need to scale your Kafka cluster and processing components horizontally to handle increased volumes.

- **Backup and Recovery:** Implement backup and recovery strategies for Kafka topics and database data to prevent data loss.
